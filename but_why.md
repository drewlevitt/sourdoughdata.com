title: But... why "Sourdough Data"?

When I was creating my LLC, coming up with a name was one of the hardest and most fun parts.

I considered a wide variety of bucket-of-nouns names ("Urban Data Solutions," "Transit Data LLC," etc.) but felt like they were too impersonal, and not very creative.

I almost went with "King Ridge Research," which has a nice ring to it and is an homage to [one of the greatest bike rides in the Bay Area](http://bestrides.org/kings-ridge/), and therefore the world. But, a few problems there:
1. I'm not in Sonoma County.
2. The name is meaningless to anyone who doesn't already know the road.
3. Nothing in the name gets at what I actually *do*.

I *very* briefly considered "Funny Curtains LLC," which is a pun on my and my wife's last names: Levitt → Levity; Draper-Zivetz → Drapery. But I couldn't say that with a straight face to my friends and family, much less to people I was trying to do business with. Plus, Sara isn't involved anyway.

Then "Sourdough Data" came to me. I think it has a lot to like:
* Short and simple
* Mentions "data," one of my core subject areas
* Has a lot of personality
* Speaks to my Bay Area heritage and expertise
* Memorable (I hope)
* Lots of punny tagline potential
* I do in fact bake sourdough bread!

What do *you* think of the name? Praise, criticism, and (most importantly) punny tagline suggestions very welcome at [drew@sourdoughdata.com](mailto:drew@sourdoughdata.com).
